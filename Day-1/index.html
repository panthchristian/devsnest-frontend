    <h4>Dear Sir,</h4>
    <p>
      I am Lorem Ipsum (Ζεύς), studying in class 11th and I am writing this
      letter to inform you that <br />
      Devsnest is organizing a 30 day coding bootcamp for begineers. So, I
      request you to grant me <br />
      permission to attain this camp so i can quantify my knowledge and earn
      some knowledge as well. <br />
      plz. inform other students of the university as well. So they can get some
      knowledge as well
    </p>
    <p>
      Yours Sincerely, <br />
